The bootcamp tuition is $1,999 (with an early-bird price of $1,499). We offer a full refund within 7 days of the program's start date.  After the initial 7 days, a prorated refund is available.  Payment plans are also an option, allowing you to split the tuition over three months.  The typical weekly workload is 6â€“8 hours, spread across live sessions two evenings a week, weekend office hours, and independent project work. Would you like to schedule a call to discuss this further and explore potential partnership opportunities or have any other questions?
