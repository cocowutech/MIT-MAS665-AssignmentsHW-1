Subject: Partnering to Empower Your Students with AI Language Skills - APAC Bootcamp Cohort

Hi [Admissions Director Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Coco (Rong Wu), and I lead the education programs at [Bootcamp Name]. We offer intensive, career-focused bootcamps designed to equip students and young professionals with in-demand AI language skills.

Given your focus on supporting students in the APAC region, I wanted to introduce our upcoming APAC-friendly cohort.  This bootcamp is specifically timed to accommodate students in your region, featuring live sessions two evenings a week and weekend office hours.

Our program blends practical workshops, mentor guidance, and real-world projects to help students build a strong portfolio and gain a competitive edge in the AI field. We also provide comprehensive career support, including mock interviews, resume/LinkedIn reviews, and an employer showcase day.

Would next Tuesday, 10:00â€“10:30 am GMT+8 work for a quick introductory call?  I'd love to discuss how a partnership could benefit your students and answer any questions you may have.

Best regards,

Coco (Rong Wu)
